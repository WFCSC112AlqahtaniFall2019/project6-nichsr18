The Binary Insertion Sort using a vector is much faster than Insertion Sort using a linked list. This is because while using a linked list to insert and delete data is much faster in a linked list structure it is much more inefficient to iterate through a list and there is no way to access a specific element. Both of these greatly increase the run time of this sorting algorithm because you have to iterate through the list multiple times. Also in Binary Insertion Sort a binary search algorithm can be used but because there is no way in a linked list to access a specific element without iterating through all of them you cannot use a binary search algorithm.
